today was another usual day at home


we went for a long walk in the evening. chillness felt in the air. needed a light pullover to ward off the coldness.

today was also srikar's first day at school, of course online school. he had zoom meeting with his buddies online. almost all of his friends are new, his close friends from chaffey from last year all have gone on to school without worrying about the virus.

anyways time feels dragging on. but i am learning python and i want to beome proficient in this language.

we also threw away our twin mattress, it was in good shape, but we thought we made good sue of it for the past yer and half and it was time to part with it.
